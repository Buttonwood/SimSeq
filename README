SimSeqNBProject currently contains the net beans project with the initial source

getErrorProfile will contain the c source for the program that generates the
error model for the sequence simulator. I am in the process of making it
compatible on computers other than my own.

examples contains some things to run this on. Right now there is
an example mitochondrial sequence, and an example error profile
for a 100 base illumina read.
